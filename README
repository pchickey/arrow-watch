SUMMARY

Shows a simple 3D wireframe rendering of an arrow.
The camera rotation matrix is provided over the debug
serial port from an InvenSense IMU-3000 sensor board
running the Embedded MotionApps (Embedded MPL / "umpl")
software.

Button presses will cycle through four camera
prespectives. The first prespective is updated with data
from the serial port, the others are fixed orientations.
(This is not useful except to test the drawing code.)

I/O is found in umpl_interface.c
Arrow verticies and edges are found in arrow.h
main_app_loop found in arrowwatch.c
 
BUILDING

You'll need the inPulse SDK (http://getinpulse.com).
Setup environment variables for your SDK, ARM toolchain,
and python installation in the Makefile.rules file.
